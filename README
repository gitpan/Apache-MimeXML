NAME
    Apache::MimeXML - mod_perl mime encoding sniffer for XML files

SYNOPSIS
    Simply add this line to srm.conf or httpd.conf:

      PerlTypeHandler Apache::MimeXML

    Alternatively add it only for certain files or directories using
    the standard Apache methods. There is about a 30% slowdown for
    files using this module, so you probably want to restrict it to
    certain XML locations only.

DESCRIPTION
    An XML Content-Type sniffer. This module reads the encoding
    attribute in the xml declaration and returns an appropriate
    content-type heading. If no encoding declaration is found it
    returns utf-8 or utf-16 depending on the specific encoding.

CONFIGURATION
    There are a few small configuration options for this module,
    allowing you to set various parameters.

  XMLMimeType

    Allows you to set the mime type for XML files:

            PerlSetVar XMLMimeType text/xml

    That changes the mime type from the default application/xml to
    text/xml. You can use this on a per-directory basis.

  XMLUtf16EncodingBE

    Allows you to set the encoding of big-endian (read: normal) utf
    16 (unicode) documents. The default is 'utf-16'

            PerlSetVar XMLUtf16EncodingBE utf-16-be

  XMLUtf16EncodingLE

    Allows you to set the encoding of little-endian utf-16 encoded
    documents. The default is 'utf-16-le'

            PerlSetVar XMLUtf16EncodingLE utf-16-wierd
